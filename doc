Lemmatization
Reducing a word to its root word 
Eg: running -> run
      walked->walk
      runs -> run 
    words, such as "better" might be broken down to a lemma such as "good."
Difference bw lemmatization and stemming 
Stemming just removes the prefix or suffix for eg studies - > studi but for lemma study will be the o/p 
Stemming is faster but inaccurate
